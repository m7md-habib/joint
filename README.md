# Improved Hinge Design

Description

This project focuses on enhancing the design of a mechanical hinge, as depicted in the provided 3D model, to improve its durability while adhering to the existing dimensions. The hinge features a symmetrical structure with circular mounting holes and a central pivot area, designed for load-bearing applications. The objective is to optimize performance under various loads, ensuring compatibility with Finite Element Analysis (FEA) for comparison with the baseline design.
